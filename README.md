# EdgeCase Vim Config

You should give it a try.

## Install

Just clone the directory somewhere and run `rake`.  This will symlink the necessary
files to your home directory (asking for permission before clobbering anything).

## Customizing

Customizations can be added to .vim/custom_config/username.vim and .vim/custom_config.username.gvim,
where username == `whoami`.  When Vim starts up, it will look for customization files matching the
name of the currently logged-in user.

## TODO

* Add some documentation
